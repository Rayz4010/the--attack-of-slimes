One-line description
A small action/arcade/adventure prototype where waves of slimes attack and the player must survive, upgrade, and defeat increasingly difficult slime bosses.

> NOTE: This README is a starter template. Replace engine/language-specific sections and placeholders below with actual commands and details from this repository.

## About
The Attack of Slimes is a fast-paced game prototype for learning game mechanics, balancing, and rapid prototyping. The repo contains game logic, assets (sprites/sounds), and build scripts. Update sections below to reflect the engine and toolchain used (Unity, Godot, Phaser, Pygame, etc.).

## Badges
Badges above are pulled from GitHub and Shields.io. They show:
- Build status (GitHub Actions) — update the workflow path if your workflow file name is different (example: .github/workflows/build.yml or ci.yml).
- Latest release version
- License
- Repo size
- Top language
- Open issues
- Total downloads from GitHub Releases
- Stars

If you want additional badges (Discord, CodeQL, coverage, static analysis, platform-specific build matrices) tell me which services you use and I can add them.

## Features
- Multiple slime types with different behaviors
- Wave-based enemy spawning
- Player health, attacks, and simple upgrades
- Basic UI: health, wave number, score
- Basic sound effects and particle feedback

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
Update this list to match your project's actual tech stack. Examples:
- Unity 2020.3+ (or your project's Unity version)
- Godot 3.5+ / Godot 4.0+
- Python 3.8+ (for Pygame)
- A code editor (VS Code, Rider, etc.)

### Install & Run
Replace the steps below with the correct commands for your repo.

Unity (example)
1. Open the project folder in Unity Hub.
2. Open the scene at Assets/Scenes/Main.unity.
3. Press Play in the editor.

Godot
1. Open project.godot in the Godot editor.
2. Run the main scene.

If you're not sure which applies, check the repository top-level files:
- Unity: Assets/, ProjectSettings/, .unityproj
- Godot: project.godot, .import
- Python: requirements.txt, setup.py, main.py

## Gameplay / Controls
- Movement: WASD or Arrow keys
- Attack: Left click / Spacebar
- Special: Right click / E
- Pause: Esc

Adjust to match your actual control scheme.

## Project structure
An example layout — update to match your repo:

- Assets/ or src/ — game code + assets
- docs/ — design notes, level plans
- builds/ — exported builds
- .github/ — CI and issue templates
- README.md — this file

## Development workflow
- Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feat/my-feature
- Implement and test in editor or local dev server
- Commit small, focused commits with clear messages
- Open a pull request and request review

Suggested branch naming:
- feat/<feature-name>
- fix/<bug-name>
- chore/<maintenance>

CI
- Add tests / automated playtests where possible.
- Add a build workflow for automated game builds (GitHub Actions example: build for Windows/macOS/Linux or export web builds).

## Contributing
We welcome contributions! Please:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Open a PR with a clear description and test/play instructions

Add ISSUE_TEMPLATE and PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE in .github/ to standardize contributions.

Code style:
- Follow the project's existing style for the language used (C#, GDScript, JavaScript, Python, etc.)
- Keep commits small and atomic

## License
Specify a license (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0). If you don't have one yet, add a LICENSE file. Example:
This project is licensed under the MIT License — see the LICENSE file for details.

Next steps I can take for you:
- Commit this updated README to main or a branch and open a PR.
- Detect the engine (Unity/Godot/Phaser/Pygame) from the repo and fill in exact install/run commands and CI workflow examples.
- Add specific badges (coverage, CodeQL, test, Discord) — tell me which services you use.
